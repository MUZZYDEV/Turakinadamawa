    <h3>Atiku Advocates for Crypto-Friendly Policies to Boost Youth Empowerment and Economic Growth</h3>

<p class="p_1">Atiku Abubakar has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing that Nigeria should not stifle innovation but instead create a legal framework to allow the crypto sector to flourish. He has called for reversing the Central Bank of Nigeria’s restrictions on crypto, arguing that such policies limit investment opportunities and negatively impact the country's economic development.</p>
